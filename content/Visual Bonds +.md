"The circulation of poor images thus creates “visual bonds,” as Dziga Vertov once called them.16 This visual bond was, according to Vertov, supposed to link the workers of the world with each other. [...] In a sense, his dream has come true, if mostly under the rule of a global information capitalism whose audiences are linked almost in a physical sense by mutual excitement, affective attunement, and anxiety" (Steyerl 2012, 43). 

"The image explosion of our current globalised and digitised society of the spectacle constitutes an inescapable iconomy, that mediates and governs our imagination and occasions what Stiegler would call a dis- individuation, but it also constitutes a generally shared image-environment, a ‘visual bond’ (Vertov), that is a potential medium for large-scale transindividuation" (Cox and Lund 2016, 12)

"In the fourth thesis of The Society of the Spectacle Guy Debord claims that ‘The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images.’[37] The term ‘iconomy’ refers to the global circulation of images, including the way in which art now constitutes a transnational currency. The generalised sharing of time is – among other things – established through a sharing of images and symbols or a shared relation to the same, or some of the same, images and symbols. It is to a large extent mediated by images" (Cox and Lun 2016, 11).

"Rather than the art of making images, circulationism is connected with the post-production, launching and acceleration of images, and with the public relations of images across social networks that both establish and tear apart ‘communities loosely linked by shared attention deficit’.[38] If, as Debord claims, the society of the spectacle is an expropriation of our images, of our capacity to communicate and take part in symbolic exchange" (Cox and Lund 2016, 11).
