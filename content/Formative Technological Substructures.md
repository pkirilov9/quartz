What are the conditions/contexts that give rise to formative technological substructures? What are the results of their unquestioned ubiquity? 

What are the tools you can provide? How can you enact the network(s)?

 Here we shall examine the influence of architectural technics and their capacity to condition thinking. It is only right to start with one of the canonical texts written on the topic “Towards a Philosophy of Photography” by Vilem Flusser. In his account, Flusser clarifies that technical apparatuses are products of culture and as such culture is reflected and recognisable in them. As we have already established earlier, all tools and techniques that architects have in their arsenal are mnemotechnics that act as externalised memory or storehouses of cumulative knowledge. In their most elaborate and complicated form, they take the shape of computer modelling softwares that have become an industry standard. In her essay “Deleuze, Theory, and Space”, Elizabeth Grosz defines them as “the necessary and practical facilitations of the real we need in order to make it [space] conform to our needs.” However, neither CAD nor BIM nor any post-production software originated as specifically crafted for or out of the needs of the architectural profession. The former were initially geared towards the engineering sectors, while the latter towards the film industry. Radically faster and much more precise, they facilitated architectural production, leaving design professionals in awe of their “magical” capabilities. As Zeina Koreitem points out in her essay “Some Notes on Making Images with Computers”, there is nothing wrong with this importation, however, while we were busy picking up our jaws, no one noticed that along with the automation of the mundane, time-consuming tasks, “the values of other disciplines and practices are imported as well, quietly “smuggled” in the boring, hidden innards and interfaces of the tools themselves.” The resulting reverence and obsession with precision, accuracy, efficiency, speed and other technical values was reflected in the technical minimisation of error and uncertainty together with their derivatives -  accident, inaccuracy, disturbance, unpredictability, etc. In other words, any imprecisions were deemed undesirable. However, historically these have proven to be vital for discoveries, and novel interpretations. In their emphasis on precision, or more importantly in their repulsion to error, such technics are actively supportive of the structures that establish and sustain dogmatic images of thought and suffocate invention.
