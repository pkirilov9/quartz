"Nonetheless, since deductive logic is not ampliative, that is, it is unable to add any truth that the axioms and theorems do not already tautologically presuppose, the entire structure of major architectures is not only trapped in its self-evidence, but, more importantly, is detached to an almost absolute degree from the spatial phenomena it wishes to examine and produce" (Kousoulas, 2022, p.27). Going back to Simondon, the current condition of architectural [[Representation]], defined by [[Hylomorphic Schemas]] and effectively disconnected from its associated milieu, is a case of [[Alienation]] par excellence.

The revived interest in architectural drawings made it more consumable and self-referential, in the sense that it is less concerned with what they represent than with their own constitution (Evans 1986, 5). "Buildings are representing other buildings, thus transferring their history and myths to the new" (Agrest 2000, 172) . It is this self-referential tendency through which architecture increasingly engages with its own problems, which becomes controversial given the claims of social and public engagement it enunciates. Confined in its self-evidence, it remains “detached to an almost absolute degree from the spatial phenomena it wishes to examine and produce”, aggravating the alienating state of the profession (Kousoulas, 2022, p.27).

"Representation, which has a crucial role in the articulation of the texts of architecture, sometimes becomes an end in itself. As such, it detaches itself from the represented object to become self-referential" (Agrest 2000, 165).
