The idea for the title comes from the reduction of the architect's role in the contemporary workplace to that of a "CAD-monkey", which is a common professional joke that has been circulating media platforms. The "funny" part comes from the situation many professionals (especially those who work in large offices) find themselves in which resembles the common joke of a monkey that is placed in a radically different milieu whose modes of operation it is unable to comprehend, and therefore, is worthy of our laughs. In recent times, due to the meteoric rise of Building Information Modelling (BIM) which has dethroned Computer Aided Design (CAD) as the main platform for [[Architectural Output]], a new architectural worker-primate has been introduced as a continuation of the joke - the "BIM-panzee". The traction that the primate comparison has gained over the years, establishing itself as a sphere-wide inside joke, is evidence of the implicit recognition of the dissociated, automated, and reductive processes that sustain the banality (and reality) of building.

The increasing importance of visual [[Representation]], or more precisely the production of [[Affect]]ive imagery, requires the introduction of new worker-primate species. The humdrum of contemporary architectural practice, I will argue, is maintained by our inability to grasp the wider shift in the processes that shape our work, which gave rise to the Renderilla and the Oraxotan. Yet to be explored, they offer ground for new and exciting research into the [[Contemporary Architectural Labour +]] and its modes of production that conditioned their occurrence.
