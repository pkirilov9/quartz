In architecture, second-order effects refer to the indirect or unintended consequences that arise from design decisions, often beyond the architect's direct control. These effects are the result of interactions between various elements including human behaviour, environment, culture, and time. Unlike first-order effects, which are more immediate and directly observable, second-order effects are often subtle, complex, and emerge over time. Meaning that architects may design with certain intentions, but the outcomes can unfold in unexpected ways due to numerous influencing factors, which no means of [[Representation]] or [[Abstraction]] can predict. This is due to their inherent condition to represent information in a linear fashion ([[Linear Perspective]]), which is fundamentally different to the reality of how forces within open system interact with each other. 
 
As ZUS point put, 'Architects seem to have lost the confidence to dance with the second-order effects and have even come to fear them. Much of 20th-century architecture and planning could form a catalogue of unanticipated consequences because the designers of the 20th century forgot how to navigate the push and pull of these forces, to let people in nature in as a part of the process" (Zones Urbaines Sensibles 2019, 304). This fear, or willingness to eliminate uncertainty, stemmed from a desire for predictability and stability in design outcomes, often driven by a quest for rightness or profit.

To effectively deal with second-order effects, architects need to approach design with a combination of confidence in ignorance, pragmatism, and optimism. They must acknowledge that they cannot foresee all outcomes and embrace a certain level of uncertainty in the design process. Moreover, navigating second-order effects requires a sense of gamesmanship â€“ an ability to adapt, respond, and sometimes even exploit the emergent properties that arise (Zones Urbaines Sensibles 2019, 304). This aligns with the principles of the [[Performative]] approach which I am after.

In essence, to wield second-order effects means understanding that architecture is not just about creating static structures but about shaping dynamic environments where human life unfolds. It involves recognising the interconnectedness of elements and being responsive to the evolving complexities of society, culture, and nature.
