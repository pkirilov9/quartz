- alienation of labor => alienated from milieu, relational activity, being, and collectivity => ultimate consequences = pervasive apathy and cynicism

In his essay "Alienation beyond the human: From Marx to Simondon", Carson Fritz (2021, p.26-7) explains that according to Simondon, the initial cause of alienation can be found in reductive mental forms such as [[Hylomorphic Schemas]] - when an abstract form is imposed on seemingly passive and inert matter - which is often a starting point for many architects and is deemed traditional within the practice. In their reliance on and upkeep of abstract universal truths, I find a curious connection between Simondon’s “alienation” and Deleuze’s “[[Dogmatic Image of Thought]]. Such forms of reductive thinking are fundamentally disconnected from their associated milieu, which becomes problematic once they start limiting the possible formation of new relations and actively foreclose alternative futures (Fritz, 2021, p.26-7). I find it necessary to trace the thread of alienation, and therefore invite you on a short detour where we can investigate how it has resulted in the confinement of the architectural profession. Throughout this process, we will expose the problematics entangled in architectural [[Representation]] as either a cause or a consequence of alienation. The critical analysis of the issues can be divided into two categories. The first is concerned with the enclosed, [[Self-referential]] and [[Ultra-stable]] nature of representational systems, while the second is concerned with the obscured influence of the [[Formative Technological Substructures]] and our inability to understand the tools we use.

Through a lengthy process of division of labour and adherence to economic regimes, architects have distanced themselves from processes such as building regulations, material availability, socio-political issues etc., that condition the design process long before a brief arrives at their desk. Often literally isolated from our associated milieu we continue to search for “solutions” to problems posed by fluctuating, open systems employing rigid, [[Hylomorphic Schemas]], and linear means of design ([[Linear Perspective]], [[Image-Object Fixation]]). 

Both categories of alienation - the [[Ultra-stable]], [[Self-referential]], closed systems and technological (en)framing - have played their part in the constitution of some very persistent and widespread conceptions of the role of the architect. They have valorised form-finding exercises that are often combined with partly metaphors to legitimise design (Frichot, 2019, p.108). All the while, as Antoine Picone (2004, p.13) points out, the whole design process remains contained “in the head of the architect”, who nevertheless claims the output to be of public service, which fundamentally contradicts its isolated conception. All of that is visible in the popular description of the heroic figure of the architect as an “autonomous creative agent’ in the words of Massumi (1998, p.3), whose elevated and inspired vision is capable of moulding abstract architectural objects and “artfully dropping” them into the environment, thereby improving it. However, as both Massumi and Guattari demystify such conceptions, what we are left with is the figure of the Architect-[[Primate]], alienated from its surroundings and the modes of production that govern its work, which remains self-contained and shortsighted, its gaze only reaching what is right in front of it - a screen, a toolbox … an image.

Following the issues observed in the previous sections, [[Representation]] emerges as the meeting point of an immense amount of architectural issues that are manifested in pictorial practices, whose behaviour and modes of production we fail to grasp, ultimately resulting in alienation. The question remains, how to battle alienation? The first step is to recognise that in its commercial, contemporary incarnation, architecture is predominantly occupied with image production. However, the next step, which is more of an expedition, is to begin grappling with image ontology and epistemology, understanding its inherent qualities and processes that shape it. Finally, this begs the question, what is an [[Image]]?
