- alienation of labor => alienated from milieu, relational activity, being, and collectivity => ultimate consequences = pervasive apathy and cynicism

In his essay "Alienation beyond the human: From Marx to Simondon", Carson Fritz (2021, p.26-7) explains that according to Simondon, the initial cause of alienation can be found in reductive mental forms such as [[Hylomorphic Schemas]] - when an abstract form is imposed on seemingly passive and inert matter - which is often a starting point for many architects and is deemed traditional within the practice. In their reliance on and upkeep of abstract universal truths, I find a curious connection between Simondon’s “alienation” and Deleuze’s “[[Dogmatic Image of Thought]]. Such forms of reductive thinking are fundamentally disconnected from their associated milieu, which becomes problematic once they start limiting the possible formation of new relations and actively foreclose alternative futures (Fritz, 2021, p.26-7). I find it necessary to trace the thread of alienation, and therefore invite you on a short detour where we can investigate how it has resulted in the confinement of the architectural profession. Throughout this process, we will expose the problematics entangled in architectural [[Representation]] as either a cause or a consequence of alienation. The critical analysis of the issues can be divided into two categories. The first is concerned with the enclosed, [[Self-referential]] and [[Ultra-stable]] nature of representational systems, while the second is concerned with the obscured influence of the [[Formative Technological Substructures]] and our inability to understand the tools we use.

Through a lengthy process of division of labour and adherence to economic regimes, architects have distanced themselves from processes such as building regulations, material availability, socio-political issues etc., that condition the design process long before a brief arrives at their desk. Often literally isolated from our associated milieu we continue to search for “solutions” to problems posed by fluctuating, open systems employing rigid, [[Hylomorphic Schemas]], and linear means of design ([[Linear Perspective]], [[Image-Object Fixation]]).
