- Circulationism - not concerned with the art of making images but their post-production, launching and acceleration, public relations of images across social networks that establish and tear apart communities; suavely vacuous
- digital technology = a new organization of the circulation of the symbolic => production of the symbolic becomes industrial, subject to industrial processes
- Dependent on [[Media]]
