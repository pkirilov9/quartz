Given our non-stop online presence, it is safe to say that "the media that interconnect us make us contemporaneous". The generalised sharing of time, which defines [[Contemporaneity]] is – among other things – established through a sharing of images and symbols or a shared relation to the same, or some of the same, images and symbols, creating [[Visual Bonds +]] (Cox and Lund 2016, 11-12). The global circulation of [[Image]]s and the workings of new media realities increasingly seem to mediate social relations and the social imaginary (Lund 2021, 6), where "cinematic politics become post-representational - they do not educate the crowd, but produce it" (Steyerl 2012, 73).In these new media, the fundamental ontology of [[Image]]s is inflated and manifests itself in new ways (Mitchell 2005, 97). It is precisely due to this inflation that the underlying [[Technological Substructures +]], circulatory systems, and operational capacities of the [[Networked Image +]] become visible. For example, Instagram may not be the ideal platform for meaningful discourse on imaging in architecture, but it has undeniably become one of the most culturally impactful pieces of software (Canizares 2019, 524), where "audiences are linked almost in a physical sense by mutual excitement, affective attunement, and anxiety" (Steyerl 2013, 43). Therefore, media should be viewed as dynamic entities, functioning as environments for creating meaning and symbolic exchange, where processes of large-scale transindividuation and subjectification occur (Cox and Lund 2016, 29).
