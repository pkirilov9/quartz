The notion of visual bonds, termed by Dziga Vertov, reflects the interconnectedness mediated by images that define our [[Contemporaneity]], as discussed by Cox and Lund (2016). In our current globalized and digitized society, the proliferation of [[Image]]s constitutes what Cox and Lund term an "iconomy," governing our imagination and contributing to what Stiegler would describe as a disindividuation (Cox and Lund 2016, 12). However, alongside this, it also creates a shared image-environment, referred to as a 'visual bond' by Vertov, which has the potential to facilitate large-scale transindividuation.

Guy Debord, in the fourth thesis of "The Society of the Spectacle," argues that the spectacle is not merely a collection of images but a social relationship mediated by images (Cox and Lund 2016, 11). This highlights the role of images in shaping social interactions and shared experiences, contributing to a general sharing of time and establishing a common relation to images and symbols, in societies characterized by fragmented attention spans and transient communities (Steyerl 2012).

This implies that our images, and by extension our interactions, are heavily influenced and shaped by the visual bonds enabled by the spatio-temporal compression of online [[Media]], which upholds Debord's theory that the society of the spectacle, "is an expropriation of our images, of our capacity to communicate and take part in symbolic exchange" (Cox and Lund 2016, 11).
