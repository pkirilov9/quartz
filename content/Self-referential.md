It is this self-referential tendency through which architecture increasingly engages with its own problems, which becomes controversial given the claims of social and public engagement it enunciates. Confined in its self-evidence, it remains “detached to an almost absolute degree from the spatial phenomena it wishes to examine and produce” (Kousoulas, 2022, p.27). Going back to Simondon, the current condition of architectural [[Representation]], defined by hylomorphic schemas and effectively disconnected from its associated milieu, is a case of [[Alienation]] par excellence.
