What I mean by elucidating is the search for a type of montage that produces something outside of itself, something that belongs to a different order and requires frames of reference that might be unfamiliar to architecture. Inspired by Aurora Hoel's notions of "amplified visual systems" that see more and see differently, my goal is not to produce something that imitates what is already visible, but rather make visible and in the process open up new sensibilities (Hoel 2021, 122). However, this seems like a monumental task, and new ways of seeing require new forms of literacy to understand the hidden realm of algorithms and database structures used in computer vision (Cox 2022, 108). This involves developing a co-constituted literacy that is sensitive to relational operations, shifting focus from merely acquiring technical skills to exploring new aesthetic practices. Such literacy aims to reveal the politics of invisibility and envision other potentials (Cox 2022, 111). The point would then be to come up with ways to institute new, either more evolved regimes of visuality, or ones that work in a different modality and make intelligible that which evades common [[Representation]] and remains in its [[Out-of-field]] (Hoel 2020, 295). 

My approach to this task takes the form of [[Exercises]] because they re-situate the archival capacities of representation by opening it up to the contingent forces that the concept of [[Hosting]] is capable of accommodating by allowing for [[Performative]]  action to take place within a [[Set]].
