‘Recognition is located as a first step toward representation, the recapitulation and security of the same in identity (ad nauseum)’ (Deleuze 1994, 138). Representation and recognition are inextricably linked, for what is represented is that which is recognised. Recognition leads to established styles of representation securing the presumed good and common sense of design, guaranteeing its rightness and reassuring the designers. "Recognisable design precedents become a must so that critics can be reassured by what they recognise" (Frichot 2019, 173). Burdened with the model of recognition, thought loses the ability to wrest itself free of the forces that oppress it and render it stagnant.[[(Re)Assurance]] 

'The teacher, or in this instance the critic or architectural ‘jury member’ habitually refers to taught concepts, the already known, the images that have given pleasure previously, all the while demanding the new" (Frichot 2016, 167). [[Self-referential +]] [[Recycling]]
