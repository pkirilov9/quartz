 'Architects seem to have lost the confidence to dance with the second-order effects and have even come to fear them. Much of 20th-century architecture and planning could form a catalogue of unanticipated consequences because the designers of the 20th century forgot how to navigate the push and pull of these forces, to let people in nature in as a part of the process" (ZUS ???, 304). This can be seen as a consequence of the strive for predictability and stability which can guarantee, rightness, or profit.

"By their very nature, second-order effects are forces out of reach, unable to be controlled directly. To wield them demands a combination of confidence in ignorance, pragmatism, optimism, and above all, gamesmanship. This way of working treats the city like a game of chess, where you hope to anticipate your opponent's moves, but you can never know for sure. [...] Anticipate these "moves" by attempting to divide the latent tendencies of a place, and by revealing this natural potential to minimal design interventions" (ZUS ???, 304).
