 An entry point to a much wider issue in architecture and also an intuitive affirmation of the problem. This resembles the common joke of a monkey that is placed in a radically different milieu whose modes of operation it is unable to comprehend, and therefore, it is worthy of our laughs.

The increasing importance of visual [[Representation]], or more precisely the production of [[Affect]]ive imagery, has given rise to new architectural worker-primate species. Yet to be explored, they offer ground for new and exciting research into the [[Contemporary Architectural Labour +]] and its modes of production that conditioned their occurrence.
The traction that the primate comparison has gained over the years, establishing itself as a sphere-wide inside joke, is evidence of the implicit recognition of the dissociated, automated, and reductive processes that sustain the banality (and reality) of building. The humdrum of contemporary architectural practice, I will argue, is maintained by our inability to grasp the wider shift in the processes that shape our work, which gave rise to the Renderilla and the Oraxotan.
