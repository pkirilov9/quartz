Pictorial practices nowadays perform as coping mechanisms in situations of self-doubt when uncertainty creeps in to question the core of our decisions and presumptions as designers, threatening the futurity of our brain-child (Kousoulas 2023, 29). That is when we seek shelter in pictorial practice, it provides “stability” and assurance, presumed due to its longstanding reign as a template for rightness stemming from the tradition of the Western-centric episteme of positivist thinking obsessed with logic and control. [[Representation]] is how we cope in the face of uncertainty. When seen as steaming from a sort of fixed essence, geometric language tends towards objectivism - the ideological parody of objectivity - self-assurance, and certainty about the sovereign subject's grip on the real (Mitchell 2005, 157). In the words of Massumi (1998, 4), when architecture is seen as a language, "forms become elementary and elementary forms are “words” signifying “universal” principles of fixity" drawn from a preexisting vocabulary. This creates a felling that architectural relations are "emanating from some essence" (Fritz 2021, 9). Presupposing the essential character of those relations and their universal validity, perpetuates architectural thought towards a state of [[Ultra-stable]] equilibrium, where, "there is no metastability, no potential for becoming, and indeed no change or history—just fixed essences"(Fritz 2021, 9). This mode of thinking exemplifies the modernist ideal that is founded on “universal”, Western-centric, abstract, truths that are the result of the long-lasting project of enlightenment. However, "drawing is not writing and architecture does not speak" (Evans 2000, xxxvi).

In a disciplinary or regulating mechanism involving the built environment, the transmission of these essences to future generations through drawing provides the continuity of knowledge (Kent Fitzsimons 2010, 16), where truth is seen as something certain and representable. This shift started with Descartes, who redefined being as something that can be objectively represented, and truth as the certainty of this representation. From that point forward, [[Representation]] stopped being about mimicking or experiencing phenomena and instead became the foundation of truth. From then on, in Western thought, representation meant creating a framework that lets us understand the world as an [[Image]], establishing humans as rational beings who can objectify the world, and simultaneously restricting our knowledge to what can be rationally represented (Rubinstein and Sluis 2013, 25-6). The long-lasting reign of representation and its unconditional valorisation, has lead to the point where,"it is impossible to imagine the potential of a human being who is not experiencing the world as a subject, for whom the world in not an image or a picture" (Dewdney 2022, 35).

Positioned in the context of the building industry, this paradigm sets certain expectation of a design, which must have already delivered reliable outcomes, in order to reach construction. At this point, its rightness, which is equated to profit, is already taken as given. In their capacity to produce quantifiable and predictable outcomes that guarantee profit in a calculable future, pictorial practices seem peculiarly well suited to facilitate the process of generating a design and to guarantee its “rightness”. People involved in construction often feel restricted by the need to strictly adhere to the predefined parameters that guarantee economic success. Efforts to build in new ways are frequently blocked by practical and cultural barriers such as habits, risk aversion, standardization, warranties, costs, etc. Additionally, there's often a lack of willingness or ability to maintain buildings that need special care. Using non-standard materials places builders outside the usual support and regulatory systems, making them more accountable for their choices (Material cultures 2024, 16-7). Therefore, designers and builders must be willing to take on even more responsibility and risk. Carson Fritz (2021, 26) suggest that this conditions an environment in which "every invention or artistic endeavour to be predictably saleable as a commodity which results in profound limitations on the possibility of artistic or technological experimentation since every creation is yoked in advance to the ‘form-intention’ of profit." Any deviation from the prescribed formulas for success are seen as unnecessary risks, leaving only the safest bets as possible options. These typically involve the [[Recycling]] of themes and [[Precedent]]s that have proven their success. The consequence is an increasingly self-absorbed and [[Self-referential]] practice. The anxious state and over-concern with liability confines architectural practice inside a "proprietary fortress" (Material cultures. 2024, 66), where necessary maintenance and repairs are considered signs of failure. This generates a culture where architects no longer design with materials but rather with packaged, proprietary products only to strengthen the hold of commodification over the building industry.
