What are the conditions/contexts that give rise to the out-of-field? 

What are the tools you can provide? How can you enact the network(s)?

Just like movie directors, renderillas and oraxotans perform their own kind of framing - picking the right view, choosing the right textures, adjusting the light, selecting the actors in the scene, etc. As Deleuze (1997, p.18) explains, “Framing is the art of choosing the parts of all kinds, which become part of a set.” However, he continues to add that the set is an artificially closed system which performs an “informatic” role, communicating through its constitutive parts with the audience. Unlike other set designers, the architectural worker-primate has to assemble its set within an extremely closed system, and in such systems what is often more important is not what makes the cut, but rather what remains consciously overlooked. As we have already shown, in architecture, that is almost everything of contemporary value. Needless to say, practices of farming that constitute extremely closed systems are only aggravating the alienated ([[Alienation]]) state of the profession and distance it even further from the actual problems that need to be addressed.
