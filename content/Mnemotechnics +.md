Mnemotechnics are “storehouses of the cumulative knowledge and wisdom we now refer to as “culture,” whose memory exceeds the lifespan of the finite individual”(May, 2019, p.39). They are what Bernard Stiegler calls tertiary forms of retention, or material inscriptions of memory, which perform as an "externalisation of memory, which in turn determine our retrieval and understanding of the past and possible projections of the future" (Huy, 2012, p.390), highlighting their archival nature ([[Archive]]). "Memory and consciousness are thus inherently technical" (Nilson 2022, 5) and "transindividuation is only made possible by tertiary retentions constituted by the artificial organs of technics and mnemotechnics, or technicities in Simondon’s parlance" (Radman 2022, 3). 
Following this logic, [[Representation]]al techniques (linear perspective, parallel projections, etc.) must be viewed not simply as a techniques, but as an "epistemological framework in which the act of seeing the world is reinvented on a scientific basis, where the experience of space is reduced to the abstraction of mathematical space" (Aurieli, ???). It follows that "to create a means of measurement does more than provide a means for gauging a phenomenon, it institutes a way of seeing and relating to the world", it instructs (Bacon 2013, 79). "It is no coincidence, therefore, that Simondon interchangeably refers to [[Image]]s as schemas of action or behaviour" (Hoel 2022, 18). "In other words, architectural technicity is ‘the posteriori becoming a priori’. According to Hui, memory is empirical, hence posteriori, but once it is recorded it becomes the condition of new experiences, hence a priori" (Radman 2022, 3).
