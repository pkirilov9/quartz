Being an [[Ultra-stable]], closed, and [[Self-referential]] system, architectural [[Representation]] remembers and is remembered exclusively through a defined range of practices that have gained a canonical status. In its inability to allow for difference within its system, representation is reliant only on what can be recognised and what can be made intelligible through the already established modes of production. Consequently, a large portion of the practices that cannot be presented through the recognised pictorial practices remain obscured. Given all of this, that mode of remembrance is similar to the prevalent institutionalised mode of archiving, where the archive is continuously safeguarded, sanitised, polished and able to present only a very particular version of the truth. Architectural [[Image]]ry, in its conservative archival form that is responsible for transmitting knowledge, embodies the incredibly opportunistic mindset that has celebrated [[Abstraction]] and its embodiment as an architectural object, while systematically excluding alternative modes of recording which are capable of elucidating networks of production and other modes of doing.
