"It is becoming more and more evident that the plurality of times today are not only existing at the same time, in parallel to each other but that they interconnect and are being brought to bear on the same present, a kind of planetary present even though of course it is unevenly distributed and shared. We call this planetary present “contemporaneity”: a cluster of different historical trajectories, scales, and localities that are interconnected, rather than simply parallel to each other "(Portanova 2021, 14-5). This "planetary instantaneity in which everyone and everything takes part" (Cox and Lund 2016, 2) is enabled by spatiotemporal compression of the internet and new media platforms.

- generalised sharing of time established through a sharing of images and symbols, shared relation to (partly) the same images and symbols [[Visual Bonds +]]
- planetary scale transindividuation

- pseudo-co-presence that is possible because of computational technologies
- The Internet => extreme spatial and temporal compression - pseudo-presence
