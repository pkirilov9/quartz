The fixation on form and sign as language is closely related to the fixation on [[Image]]s that architects often idolise. The pristine plan, section, or perspective view can be an object of intense admiration and reverie. When combined with the rigid, immobile section of time that [[Linear Perspective]] provides, the disproportionate amount of time and effort concentrated on moulding [[Set]]s - the organisation of internal forces (Deleuze, 1997, p.,24) - of the built entities gives rise to what has been observed as the continual fetishisation of the fixed architectural object. The image/object fixation can be traced back to our own fixation as designers to protect our ideas from being altered in the process of realisation. Furthermore, this can be accredited to our delusions for grandeur and stardom dating back to the idolisation of the persona of the architect and more recently the “starchitect”, as well as to educational practices within universities that emphasise individual production and physical outcomes, often in the form of images. The images we produce are equated to our input to the final result, therefore the likeness of the images produced during the project phase to the actual built edifice results in gratification, acknowledging that our vision has persevered through this lengthy process and with it the little agency that has left in the hands of the architect. This condition of guarding the vision at all costs is a consequence of the alienating practices ([[Alienation]]) that fortify the [[Dogmatic Image of Thought]] and technological enframing. Through a lengthy process of division of labour and adherence to economic regimes, architects have distanced themselves from processes such as building regulations, material availability, socio-political issues etc., that condition the design process long before a brief arrives at their desk. Often literally isolated from our associated milieu we continue to search for “solutions” to problems posed by fluctuating, open systems employing rigid, [[Hylomorphic Schemas]], and linear means of design (Moe, 2019, p.120). Making their way into the [[Post-orthographic]] mode of production, these problematic tendencies have given rise to what Bruno Latour describes as the phenomenon of “object-oriented softwares” (Frichot, 2019, p.98). This phenomenon further aggravates the obsessive behaviour of design professionals, however, the irony of this protectionism is evident in the words of Felix Guattari: 
<p align= "center">“The object of architecture has been smashed to pieces. It is useless to hold on to what it was or what it ought to be! Situated at the intersection of political stakes of the first importance, of democratic and ethnic tensions, of economic, social and regional antagonisms that are nowhere near resolved, spurred on by constant technological and industrial mutations, it is irreversibly condemned to being dragged and pulled in every direction.” (Guattari,1989, p.1-2) </p>
