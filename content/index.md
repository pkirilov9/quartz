  <p align="justify">Click, click, click, clicking away our day. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swiping away our lunch breaks. Scroll, scroll, scroll, scrolling away from each other. Pan, zoom, cut! Now make it less transparent. Actually no, undo it. Ctrl-z. One more time, one more … maybe try a different angle. Have you heard…? The “CAD-monkey” has been replaced by the “BIM-panzee”. I find our ability to laugh at our despair quite amusing, although, this sort of self-deprecating humour is an instance worthy of research itself. However, to keep this light, I think there is still untapped potential in the comparison of the architectural worker to various primate species. Have we forgotten about the post-production virtuosos who specialise in spectacular views on bright and sunny days, or exploded axonometric drawings that seem impossible to reassemble? How about the “render-illa”? Do you like it? Or the “or-axo-tan”? I think they are catchy, but if you have better suggestions, get back to me. More importantly, beyond letting in the “renderillas” and the “oraxotans” on the inside joke, lies the importance of a gesture which points towards a wider shift within the profession. The shift in question, or the recognition of “renderilla” and the “oraxotan” as vital actors within architectural dynamics, can be accredited to the increasing importance of visual representation, or more precisely the production of affective imagery. </p>
<p align="justify">*This interactive repository seeks to explore the obscured onto-epistemology of the images we hold so dear, the networks that they shape, disrupt, and influence and the processes in which they are entangled.* </p>
  
 <p align="justify">Venture into an exploration of the myriad of links, get purposefully lost in the rabbit hole of visual culture, embrace chance along with the possibility of an unscripted interaction, and make up your own insights! </p>
