Representation and recognition are inextricably linked, for what is represented is that which is recognised. Recognition leads to established styles of representation securing the presumed good and common sense of design, guaranteeing its rightness and providing a sense of [[(Re)Assurance]] in designers. In an architectural context this process is exemplified by the obligatory "recognisable design precedents", which are there to reassure critics by providing the necessary comparison to something that they recognise (Frichot 2019, 173). Driven by the comfort of recognition and the desire to meet established standards, the over-reliance on precedents in architectural practice can stifle creativity and innovation. This condition is present both in educational and professional circles, and as Frichot (2016, 167) notes, "The teacher, or in this instance the critic or architectural ‘jury member’ habitually refers to taught concepts, the already known, the images that have given pleasure previously, all the while demanding the new" (Frichot 2016, 167). Burdened with the model of recognition, thought loses the ability to wrest itself free of the forces that oppress it and render it stagnant. This paradoxical expectation places a burden on architects to balance innovation with recognisability, often resulting in the [[Recycling]] of familiar themes. 

In the digital age, the problem is exacerbated by the pervasive influence of [[Media]] platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and architectural blogs. These platforms thrive on the rapid dissemination and consumption of visual content, often prioritising [[Image]]s that are easily recognisable and immediately appealing, only to strengthen what David Joselit (2013) calls the "aesthetics of the search engine". The overreliance on precedents not only hampers creativity but also leads to a more [[Self-referential +]] practice that is heavily influenced by the circulation of images on media platforms. This phenomenon is a byproduct of the architectural community's tendency to look inward for validation and inspiration, creating a closed loop of repetitive designs and concepts. By continually referencing and replicating designs that have proven lucrative, architects and developers align their work with market-driven imperatives rather than the pursuit of new, context-specific solutions. This practice reinforces the commodification of architecture, transforming buildings into mere products designed for maximum financial return rather than meaningful contributions to the built environment. The focus on economically successful precedents perpetuates a cycle where architectural value is measured primarily in monetary terms, highlighting its [[Complicity]] in the broader mechanisms of market capitalism that prioritise profit over public good and cultural significance.
