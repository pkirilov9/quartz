Here I want to emphasise the importance of hosting as an alternative form of archiving ([[Archive]]). Unlike recording or representing, hosting is capable of encompassing the entirety of an event, therefore it is not necessary to rely on representational forms of knowledge transmission, on the contrary, it can activate [[Non-representation]]al modes of learning which happen through doing. Such exercises resemble primary school science experiments and emphasise tacit, minor knowledge. I see those exercises as a distinctive form of [[Set]]s in the sense that they set up the context for an event to play out. Much like the framing sets, the exercises provide the necessary conditions for things to happen, however, unlike common representational techniques, they involve the [[Performative]] processes and make them legible or perhaps sensible. Exercises hold the capacity to reengage subjects because they require actual activity and output of energy. They require interaction and through it aim to produce new forms of literacy which can enable critical thought. Those actions actively battle [[Alienation]] and reintroduce a sense of engagement.
