Images are an essential part of architecture, there is no getting around it, they are the quantification of architectural thought. In that sense, they are a very convenient materialisation of effort, an actual outcome that can be monetised, something you can charge for. It is what you get paid to do. Hence, everything is equated to its capacity to be shown. That which remains excluded, the “[[Out-of-field]]”, due to its inability to be translated to the realm of the visual, is considered less valuable if acknowledged at all because it cannot be equated to capital. One can recognise the emergent problem in the words of Robin Evans (1984, p.481), “Architecture begins and ends in pictures, but pictures don’t give us all we need”, because “not all things architectural […] can be arrived at through drawing” (Evans, 1985, p.5) Therefore, in a state where “image is everything and everything is an image”, much of the un-imagable is essentially neglected. We have to confront the power of the fictional realities we create as their capacity to produce very real effects cannot be underestimated. Echoing Frichot (2014, p.163), in presenting future outputs as static, polished and idealised objects lies the danger of how easily the images we produce can enact [[Prescriptive Realities]], essentially predetermining processes of subjectification and dismissing the possibility of alternative future expressions (of both spaces and people). Further on, those usually well-intentioned pictorial practices get entangled in networks of market and informational capitalism, becoming complicit in detrimental practices of capital extraction and aestheticisation of politics ([[Complicity]]). This is visible in the growing practice of including renders in contracts, making the verisimilitude between image and further physical incarnation obligatory. Anthony Vidler (2000, p.17) defines this current state of production as “image as architecture and architecture as image.” To begin to unpack this quote we need to understand that, in our current mode of production ([[Post-production]], [[Post-orthographic]]) architectural [[Abstraction]] - the events playing out on our 3D modelling playgrounds - has exponentially increased its significance. Any variety of forms generated in our [[Representation]]s is now very easily translated into built form due to the increasingly intimate bond between the tools we use to make digital representations and industrial production. Hence, image truly becomes architecture. The second part of Vidler’s statement is two-fold. First, we can interpret it as the increasing tendency of “frontal ontology”, where contemporary architecture relies on visually impactful shapes or materials that impress the distanced viewer, reducing experience to a retinal journey. Second, it can be understood as how we consume architecture - mainly in the form of images that circulate in social [[Media]] platforms, architectural journals and blogs, movies, books, YouTube tutorials etc. In their circulation, repetition, and [[Recycling]] images hold the power to raise land and property prices, promoting practices of homogenisation and gentrification, that make neighbourhoods increasingly inaccessible for some who have lived there for years ([[Complicity]]). Homogenising practices are not only responsible for the displacement of people but also for the loss of locality and its intricacies. In their capacity to inspire global trends, images can inspire a desire for a certain look that designers have seen and want to achieve, which is dependent on the import and over-extraction of materials causing lasting environmental impacts ([[Out-of-field]]). To quote Frichot (2019, p.165) once again, “The [[Affect]]ive labour of images, and how they operate in a reciprocal, if disjunctive, relation with the concepts and discursive statements architects enunciate.” In other words, what we produce blindly, unaware of the systems is going the enter, once entangled in networks out of our realm, gains entirely new meaning which is contrary to what we claim to fight for.

Following the issues observed in the previous sections, [[Representation]] emerges as the meeting point of an immense amount of architectural issues that are manifested in pictorial practices, whose behaviour and modes of production we fail to grasp, ultimately resulting in [[Alienation]]. The question remains, how to battle alienation? In fact, we have already taken the first step, which is to recognise that in its commercial, contemporary incarnation, architecture is predominantly occupied with image production. However, the next step, which is more of an expedition, is to begin grappling with image ontology and epistemology, understanding its inherent qualities and processes that shape it. Finally, this begs the question, what is an image? In the words of William Mitchell: 
<p align= "center">You can hang a picture, but you cannot hang an image. […] It is what can be lifted off the picture, transferred to another medium, translated into verbal ekphrasis, or protected by copyright law. (Mitchell, 2005, p.85) </p>
Here Mitchell provides an updated version of the traditional [[Signifying Semiotics]], which have a common understanding of images as signs, or as Martin Schwab (2000, p.110) puts it “signs that present their meaning in an iconic mode.” Meaning, that they communicate through structural analogues of what they want to convey, and as a mode of re-presentation rely on mimesis or similarity. In his book “What Do Pictures Want?” Mitchell transcends this conception and goes on to argue that images are much more than simply what they look like. The distinction between image and picture inverts the common perception that images are static entities. Images are inherently agile due to their ability to move from one medium to another, but also to transcend the medium itself. That is to say that although what we consume is transmitted visually, the image remains independent of its medium (Shwarte, 2019, p.85), it is that which can be “lifted off”. Another mistake that we should avoid is to think of images as singularities. As Hélène Frichot reminds us in her essay “Gentri-Fiction and Our (E)States of Reality”, we should not understand images as singular entities that operate by themselves in an isolated state. Their dynamic character stems from the way they operate in “animated networks or assemblages”, or as Deleuze famously points out, “The image is not an object but a “process” (citation?). Furthermore, they possess a certain duality, “they are made but also in the process of becoming” (Backlund et al., 2019, p.15), at the same time they are constructed by and within their environments and have the capacity to reconstruct them. This process of becoming is illustrated in their movement through various networks and how they transform them, all the while transforming themselves as a part of this encounter. Therefore, in the words of Sjoerd van Tuinen (2019, p.229), the image makes no significant movement without itself transforming, and its becoming is defined by the way it adds itself to its environment and therefore changes it.

Semiotic practices have been established as the dominant mode of how we perceive, appropriate, and present information, therefore, laying the basis for learning itself. In the words of Marc Boumeester (2019, p.53), “The way we perceive is not only learned but also part of the way we learn.” It follows that images possess the power to mediate our worldly perception and their far-reaching effects can be traced from changing trends to behavioural biases, political propaganda, gentrification, and displacement of people ([[Complicity]]). Following Nelson Goodman, no longer simply mirroring the world, images are “ways of worldmaking” (citation?). Contrary to the common understanding embedded in [[Signifying Semiotics]], the power of images does not lie in their “signs” and the messages that they are transferring mimetically, but it stems from the networks that they infiltrate, from, or reinvent. In our current systems of overproduction of images and sensory overload, the [[Value]] of an image is no longer equated to the production of novel thought, information, or content, but rather with their “reproductive potency and fertility” (Mitchell, 2005, p.90), or how easily they can connect to existing ideas, social and political agendas, capital etc ([[Search Engine]]). The way I like to simplify this is to visualise it, ironically yet adequate and in favour of the laid arguments, similar to an infinite frenzy of billiard balls hitting and bouncing off each other, breaking, forming and joining clusters yet confined within the borders of the pool table. This confinement proves to be rather important because although dynamic, as Hito Steyerl (2012, p.5) warns us, images are not ephemeral because they are “lodged in a circulatory system of desire and exchange, which itself relies on a very specific economic regime”([[Complicity]]). Therefore, images are in a peculiar position. On one hand, they can be utilised towards further strengthening dogmatic tendencies, facilitating exploitation and confinement, on the other, they hold liberating potential, performing as prophets illuminating the future that until now could not have been depicted (Mitchell, 2005, p.168).
