- the idea of the [[Precedent]] and that what has already been done is feasible 
- endless reformatting and [[Recycling]] of [[Content]]
- [[Value]] of images does not reside in the novelty factor, but in the capacity to be connected into various other notions; retrieval of intelligible patterns in slightly different visual form 
- Architecture becomes [[Self-referential]] => buildings are representing other buildings, transferring their history and myths to the new
- all those images, as templates, prototypes and sources of inspiration, play a crucial role in generating ideas 
- Pinterest and Instagram provide and therefore create a need for endless production of new imagery among other [[Media]] platforms - an increasingly insatiable thirst for images => exhaustive combinatorials of images, partially recalling previous images.
-  reformat existing streams of images and information

What are the conditions/context give rise to the epistemology and aesthetics of the search engine? 
- recycling and retrieval of intelligible content on ubiquitous media platforms
- the requirement to justify with previously successful examples 
- finding "inspiration" 
- capacity to produce [[Visual Bonds]]
- the shifting value of images which now have to contain intelligible patterns that ensure connectivity 
 
What are the tools you can provide? How can you enact the network(s)?

In the rampant exploitation of [[Affect]] many have identified a steady convergence between architectural [[Representation]] and marketing strategies, up to the point where the boundaries between the two have been smudged. This is evident in the tendency to easily reduce [[Architectural output]] to recognisable icons and totalising images (Søberg, 2019, p.189). In this regard, architectural imagery is growing increasingly similar to the “vulgar” modes of imaging as Mitchell (2005, p.39) calls them - commercials, propaganda etc. - and their blunt and unapologetic expression of desire. And just like such, in their ubiquity and commodification, the “ceaseless bombardment of unrelated imagery” intended for the postponement of boredom that Pallasmaa describes (2012, p.35), is a continuous subject of reproduction, reformatting and [[Recycling]]. Increasingly more accessible, only a few clicks away, the perpetual waves of [[Image]]s become a main source of “inspiration”, templates for what is acceptable or in style, and shape what David Joselit calls “the epistemology and aesthetics of the search engine.” In his book “After Art” Joselit explains that in the [[Ecology of images]] and the networks that shape them, the traditional source of value for images has been subverted. No longer is the [[Value]] of an image equated to its contribution to the introduction of novel concepts, opening up of new views, or creation of content not yet seen. Rather, an image accumulates value through its capacity to contain or gather as many intelligible patterns that open it up to connections with a larger amount of other images, concepts, systems, movements etc. Hence, the increasing popularity of reframing and reiterating content with slight variations. Just like in a Google search, when an image enters the enormous network of information, the more connections (results) it makes, the better. What has become blatantly evident in [[Media]] platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram, or any architectural journal is how architectural production, but also artistic or any sort of design output, is mimicking the operational structures of search algorithms, and simply “reformat existing streams of images and information” (Joselit, 2013, p.58). In this endless repetition and [[Recycling]], architectural representation is stuck mirroring its own problems, restlessly abusing its own traditions (Frampton and Cava, 2001, p.26) and becoming more and more [[Self-referential]] and disconnected.
