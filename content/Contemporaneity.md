The definition of contemporaneity which I will follow is laid out in the book "The Contemporary Condition" by Geoff Cox and Jacob Lund. The authors argue that contemporaneity represents a condition where multiple times coexist, creating a unique historical moment. This coexistence challenges linear perceptions of history and embraces a more layered and interconnected understanding of time. Contemporaneity is characterised by the overlapping of different temporalities, allowing for a more nuanced engagement with the present. This "planetary instantaneity in which everyone and everything takes part" (Cox and Lund 2016, 2), or 'pseudo-co-presence', is enabled by spatiotemporal compression, of the Internet and new [[Media +]] platforms. 

With the advent of "real time"- the immediate processing and response to events as they occur- a generalised sharing of time is established. This is facilitated by the mutual relation to the same images or symbols that is established through their communal sharing in media. The result is the production of [[Visual Bonds +]] which become a corner-stone for planetary scale of transindividuation.
