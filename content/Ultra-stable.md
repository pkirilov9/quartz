The axiomatic nature of representation lies at the core of its conception as a closed system. Following the argument laid out by Stavros Kousoulas (2022, p.35) in his book “Architectural Technicities”, rooted in linear causality such a system is incapable of evolution due to its inability or denial to accommodate any external influence. Hence, we can conceive of architectural representation as an ultra-stable system with no potential for transformation. In other words, nothing can be added to a system that is naturally deductive, exclusively reliant on axioms and theorems. The outcome can be observed in the blatant [[Self-referential]]ity of architectural representation, evident in the tradition of the [[Precedent]] - a previous account which has proven to be successful and therefore acknowledged as worthy of reproduction, reformulation and [[Recycling]].
