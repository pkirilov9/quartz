The axiomatic nature of representation lies at the core of its conception as a closed system. Following the argument laid out by Stavros Kousoulas (2022, 35) in his book “Architectural Technicities”, rooted in linear causality such a system is incapable of evolution due to its inability or denial to accommodate any external influence. Hence, we can conceive of architectural [[Representation]] as an ultra-stable system with no potential for transformation or evolution. In other words, nothing can be added to a naturally deductive system, exclusively reliant on axioms and theorems. The outcome can be observed in the blatant [[Self-referential]]ity of architectural representation, evident in the tradition of the [[Precedent]] - a previous account which has proven to be successful and therefore acknowledged as worthy of reproduction, reformulation and [[Recycling]]. This further distances architectural [[Primate]]-worker from the real world, setting up the ground for [[Alienation]] to proliferate. However, as Deleuze (1997, 16) points out, a system which is closed - even one which is very closed up - only apparently suppresses the [[Out-of-field]], and in its own way gives it an even more decisive importance.
