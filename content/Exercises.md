 I created a “Booklet of Exercises in Visual Literacy,” which expands on the notion of [[Elucidating+]] by engaging in practices of seeing more and seeing differently. The exercises resemble primary school experiential learning and emphasise tacit, minor knowledge. Embodying the [[Performative +]] spirit, I see them as a distinctive form of [[Hosting]] in the sense that they set up the context for an event to play out, allowing for the contingency of the surroundings to influence the outcomes instead of preemptively disclosing them beforehand.
