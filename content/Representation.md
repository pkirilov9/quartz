Much has been said about architectural representation and my goal here is not to delve deeper into the annals of its production, significance, or graphic qualities. One thing, however, has been made pretty clear in the accounts that venture into such historical analysis. Ever since the introduction of linear perspective and its documentation in Leon Battista Alberti’s “De Pictura” there has been a gradual rise in the importance of architectural representation over the past centuries. This development has come to the point where it has become the established norm of architectural production due to its highly valuable communicational and affective capacities. Representation’s efficacy in translating architectural thought into built objects has become essential in today’s economy reliant on the division of labour, where the architect is exclusively focused on the project, rather than on its execution which is handed off to construction specialists. In its affectionate state, representation serves as a form of visual persuasion that communicates architectural vision and incites desire, longing, and anticipation within the viewers, therefore actively participating in the sourcing of funding, validation of future outcomes, and gaining public appreciation or approval. Those qualities make representation an invaluable tool for architects and it should be no surprise that it has become the bread of butter of contemporary architectural practice.

Although a perfect fit, the relationship architect-representation is not so straightforward and unproblematic. The obsessive fascination with architectural imagery, and the volumes written on guidelines, creative properties, usefulness, and semiotic importance, architects and scholars have established a cult surrounding representation and its inextricable relation to architecture’s essence. Focusing on the perpetuation of knowledge and guarding the principles of production and appearance, has exposed its [[Self-referential]] nature and it has resulted in a canonical set of rules effectively fortifying the profession. Instead of resorting to iconoclastic gestures, the more important question to ask is, how come have we ended up in a vicious circle, that keeps closing in on itself, endlessly repeating what is “right”, unable to permit anything foreign into its boundaries?
