Mnemotechnics are “storehouses of the cumulative knowledge and wisdom we now refer to as “culture,” whose memory exceeds the lifespan of the finite individual”(May, 2019, 39). They are what Bernard Stiegler calls tertiary forms of retention, or material inscriptions of memory, which perform as an "externalisation of memory, which in turn determine our retrieval and understanding of the past and possible projections of the future" (Huy, 2012, 390), highlighting their archival nature ([[Archive]]). It follows that consciousness, and therefore memory, have an inherently technical nature (Nilson 2022, 5) and processes of transindividuation are enabled by "tertiary retentions constituted by the artificial organs of technics and mnemotechnics"(Radman 2022, 3). 

Representational techniques like linear perspective and parallel projections should be understood not merely as methods, but as an "epistemological framework" that reinvents the act of seeing the world scientifically, reducing the experience of space to mathematical abstraction (Aurieli 2015). Creating a means of measurement does more than simply quantify a phenomena; it establishes a way of perceiving and relating to the world (Bacon 2013, 79). Hence, Simondon's interchangeable reference to images, in which measurement and quantification becomes physically engrained, as schemas of action or behaviour (Hoel 2022, 18). In that sense, architectural technicity represents the transformation of empirical memory into a foundational condition for new experiences, or "the posteriori becoming a priori" (Radman 2022, 3).
